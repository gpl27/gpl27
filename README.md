## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
I'm currently pursuing a a bachelor's degree in Computer Science at [UFRGS](http://ufrgs.br).
On my free time I do some [web dev](https://enem.gpl27.dev) as well as have some fun with [automation](https://github.com/stuaninauts/testobot) and [scraping](https://github.com/gpl27/twot).
